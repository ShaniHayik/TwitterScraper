This code takes Googleâ€™s last 10 tweets from Twitter and provides the following output: 
1. Hashtag list  
2. Mention list  
3. Word statistics

Please note that 100 tweets might take longer time.
The output will appear in the console after you will start the program.

The task uses google chrome driver version 88.0.4324.96, so if you don't use this version,  
please replace the file of "chromedriver.exe" in the package to your google chrome version driver.
